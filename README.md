This project implements a statistical arbitrage strategy for commodities using pairs trading. The focus is on identifying and exploiting mean-reverting behavior among closely related energy products such as Crude Oil (CL), Heating Oil (HO), and Gasoline (RB). The strategy integrates both quantitative signals and fundamental indicators from inventory data to generate high-conviction trading opportunities.
